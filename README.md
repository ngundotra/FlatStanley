# Welcome! To Flat Stanley 2017

*** What is [Flat Stanley?](https://www.flatstanley.com/about)

## Our Mission

To provide friends with a way of exploring new ideas and learning from coding wizards.

## How?

Create a shared collection of python files that we can add to, revise, and delete.

## Why [Python 3.5?](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Python is a versatile language. Python is a very valued language and easy to learn [(here's one of many online tutorials)](https://www.codecademy.com/).

It's currently used in powering Google, Youtube, cutting edge [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.tensorflow.org/), and [scientific research](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks).


## Github + Adding to Flat Stanley

Github is the website where people can freely host folders and files.
Git is the application that allows you to add to your github and other's.

0) To add to this document, you will need both a github account and [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). And access to terminal, or Window's command prompt.

1) To access these documents, you will have a space to download this project. There are 2 ways to do so:

    a) Click download this repository and download the zip file and unzip it on your computer.
    
    b) Use terminal/command prompt. **we will be adding more steps to this in the future**
    
2) Make changes! Either add or revise a project, and then submit a pull request.

3) Submit a Pull Request. Here is a short tutorial from [*The Hub Itself*](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1). Here is a long, but useful [tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/learn-git-with-bitbucket-cloud/git-branch-to-merge). 

4) Send Elina and Noah an email, and add your name to the "Name Space" below!

We will be adding a troubleshooting document as we go along.

## Add your name to this project!!

Feel free to add your names in the "Name Space" and as you contribute, add a description of what you did by your name.

### Specifics

* We are expecting users to be running **python 3.5**, as it is most commonly supported for popular machine learning / AI libraries

* When sending a pull request, please send an email to either Elina or Noah. See our last CS Club email for more information.

* We are open to suggestions! Please send us emails, texts, pull requests, etc when you have an idea or problem. We are here for both.

# Running flat_stanley.py

You will need to use your terminal. Here are the commands we will need to know:
```bash
cd - "change directory" changes the folder being accessed by your command line
ls - "list" simply lists the items in your folder
python3 <filename> - runs the file if it can be called by python3
```

Once you have this repository (fancy name for folder) installed, you can open your command line and type in "cd Desktop/your_folder_name" (capitalization and punctuation matter). This will "change directory" (change your current folder) from  your user directory to your desktop then to your folder on your desktop.

Once there, type "ls" and hit return. It will "list" all the files in that folder you are in. If "flat_stanley.py" is not in that list, then it means you have navigated to the wrong folder.

Once you are in the right folder and you see "flat_stanley.py" listed, then you can type "python3 flat_stanley.py" and hit enter.

To best view the code in the file, view it on [the github page.](https://github.com/ngundotra/FlatStanley/blob/master/flat_stanley.py)

# Editing flat_stanley.py

To write python for Flat Stanley, you need to know 2 things:

1 - we are using python 3.5 or newer

2 - Python is an interpreted language, which means it runs top to bottom. To read more, [click here.](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers)

Here are a few applications you can download to help you write and run your own python code:
    
    [PyDev](http://www.pydev.org/) which is an add-on to [Eclipse.](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)

    [PyCharm CE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) which is hella annoying to start working with sometimes, but has really helpful tools.

Here are a few online websites you can use:

    [Cloud 9](https://c9.io/) which is great + works with git but idk how.

    [REPL](https://repl.it/) which is also great, but you have to copy and paste your python code in from flat_stanley.

Here is an editor (doesn't have capability of running your code):
    
    [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is great. To run your code, you have to open up your terminal/command line and use *cd* to navigate to where you store your files. If *ls* shows flat_stanley.py is in your folder, then you can type "python3 flat_stanley.py" to run your code.

There's even an app! (but I don't know if allows us to import in our flat_stanley code):

    [Pythonista](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/) is available for iOS and is actually fun, when it's not crashing. Definitely check it out if you have an iPhone, they have lots of interesting examples. We will hopefully be working with some of the same libraries they are using in the future.

# Ask For Questions, Advice, and Guidance

We are a community of people with different skill levels. Ask more skilled friends for help in understanding their contributions; ask newer friends if they can use pointers or guidance. 

This project is centered on collaboration. So please join us on this exciting journey. 

Sincerely,
```
